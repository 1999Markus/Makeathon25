"1","Everything as a service","What are the categories of 'Everything as a Service'?","The categories include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS involves renting hardware and storage, such as Amazon EC2 and S3. PaaS provides a development and deployment framework, like Google App Engine. SaaS offers web applications, such as Gmail and Office 365."
"2","EU cloud market growth","What does the EU cloud market growth chart illustrate?","The chart shows the growth of the cloud market in the EU from 2017 to 2028, with Software as a Service (SaaS) in light blue, Platform as a Service (PaaS) in gray, and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in dark blue. The market grows from 27 billion in 2017 to 196 billion in 2028, with SaaS taking the largest share."
"3","Cloud from a provider's perspective","What are the key considerations for a cloud provider?","A cloud provider needs a data center, network, and methods for adjusting resources like computing and storage. They must ensure tenants do not interfere with each other and have a billing and accounting mechanism."
"4","Economic factors for cloud adoption","What economic factors motivate the move to cloud computing?","In pre-cloud IT, cheap computers led to departments acquiring their own servers, resulting in overlap and duplication of expertise. This turned into a major expense, motivating the move to centralized cloud computing."
"5","Data centers and racks","What are the characteristics of data center racks?","Racks allow many servers to be squeezed into a small space, with standardized sizes using height units (1U, 2U). They have connections at the back for power and network cables. A pod includes racks, storage facilities, network switches, and power connections, accommodating up to 42 servers."
"6","Cooling in data centers","How is cooling managed in data centers?","Cooling is managed by arranging racks in cold and hot aisles. The cold aisle is at the front of racks and the hot aisle at the back. A typical setup involves 500 Watt per server, 40 servers per rack, 12 racks per row, and 6 rows, totaling approximately 1.4MW."
"7","Networking in large data centers","What networking technologies are used in large data centers?","Large data centers use Ethernet networks with 10 Gbit as standard, 40 Gbit common, and 100 Gbit available. Each rack has a Top-of-Rack (ToR) switch, with additional switches connecting ToR switches."
"8","Fat tree topology","What is the fat tree topology in networking?","In a fat tree topology, links between ToR switches and other switches should be very fast. The root switch is a single point of failure, and traffic distribution is managed across different levels."
"9","Leaf-spine topology","What are the features of a leaf-spine topology?","A leaf-spine topology can survive the failure of a spine switch and can be scaled to more racks. It involves multiple racks connected to spine switches."
"10","Leaf-spine with superspine","How does a superspine level enhance a leaf-spine topology?","A superspine level addresses the limited number of connections on switches, enabling very large data centers by adding a second level of connectivity."
"11","Virtual machines and hypervisors","What role do hypervisors play in virtualization?","Hypervisors like Xen and KVM allow virtualizing hardware, enabling multiple VMs on one physical machine. They emulate a specific complete computer, such as x86, and support different operating systems."
"12","Virtualization process","How does virtualization work at the CPU level?","Modern CPUs support virtualization with Intel VT-x and AMD-V, providing three levels of privilege: hypervisor, kernel, and user mode. The hypervisor creates a VM, starts an OS, and manages application execution."
"13","I/O devices in virtualization","How are I/O devices managed in virtualization?","Hypervisors provide virtual hardware devices for each VM. When an OS accesses a device, control passes to the hypervisor, which invokes virtual device software. Emulated devices can be slower than real ones, but modern cloud vendors use hardware with built-in virtualization."
"14","Implications of virtualization","What are the implications of virtualization for security and performance?","Virtualization provides good security isolation with no major breaches reported. However, performance isolation is not perfect, as performance can vary based on neighbor tenant activities."
"15","Resource allocation strategies","What strategies are used to split hardware resources?","Strategies include fair share (static), competitive (dynamic), and token-bucket (overcommitting) methods."
"16","Virtual disks in cloud computing","What are the features of virtual disks in cloud computing?","Virtual disks allow a VM to access storage without physical access. They can be provisioned on demand, offer elastic pricing, and enable stopping a VM without data loss."
"17","Implementation of virtual disks","How are virtual disks implemented in cloud environments?","Virtual disks are connected through the network, either via Network Attached Storage (NAS) using existing networks or Storage Area Network (SAN) with a separate network, offering more predictable performance."
"18","Containers vs. virtual machines","What are the differences between containers and virtual machines?","Containers are lightweight and offer lower startup times and better memory utilization. VMs provide better security, performance isolation, and allow changing the OS. Containers in public clouds often run within VMs."
"19","Functions as a service","What is 'Functions as a Service' (FaaS) in cloud computing?","FaaS allows uploading code exposed through HTTP, which is launched and scaled automatically by the cloud provider. It is called serverless, although it runs on servers, and has limitations in practice."
"20","Unikernels in cloud computing","What are unikernels and their use in cloud computing?","Unikernels are simple single-address space operating systems used in the cloud where process isolation is not required. They are isolated by the hypervisor and support a limited set of devices."
"21","Data center total cost of ownership","What components make up the total cost of ownership (TCO) for data centers?","TCO includes capital expenses (facilities, compute, storage, networking) and operational expenses (energy, maintenance, employees). It is calculated as data center depreciation plus OPEX and server depreciation plus OPEX."
"22","Data center power consumption","How is power consumption managed in data centers?","Power is crucial, with construction costs around $10/W. A big data center might cost $200M and consume 20MW, consisting of 40,000 servers. For comparison, superMUC has about 6,000 servers using 3MW."
"23","Cost analysis example","What are the cost components in a typical data center example?","A $5,000 server with 340W peak power, $0.067/kWh electricity cost, 3-year server lifetime, 8% interest, and 5% maintenance cost per year. Data center construction cost is $10/W, depreciated over 20 years, with OPEX $0.04/W per month and PUE of 1.5."
"24","Comparison of server costs","How do different server costs compare in data centers?","A cheaper, faster server consuming 600W at peak costs $2,000 with $0.10/kWh electricity cost. Server cost is often dominant, but other costs can be significant, affecting TCO."
