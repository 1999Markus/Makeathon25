"1","Intelligent agent definition and components","What is an intelligent agent?","An intelligent agent is anything that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon the environment through actuators. Visual elements include a diagram showing the environment, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators, with arrows indicating the flow of physical quantities and signals."
"2","Thermostat as an intelligent agent","How does a thermostat function as an intelligent agent?","A thermostat acts as an intelligent agent by perceiving temperature through sensors and acting upon a valve to control the room environment. The visual shows a thermostat with labeled components: environment, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators."
"3","Robotic lawn mower as an intelligent agent","How does a robotic lawn mower function as an intelligent agent?","A robotic lawn mower perceives its environment through sensors like wheel rotation sensors and a magnetic sensor for the border wire, and it acts using wheel motors and a cutting unit. The visual shows a garden with labeled environment, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators."
"4","Automated car as an intelligent agent","How does an automated car function as an intelligent agent?","An automated car uses sensors such as video cameras, laser sensors, radar, GPS, and acceleration sensors to perceive the environment and acts through the steering wheel, brake, and throttle to navigate the road network and avoid traffic participants. The visual shows the car with labeled components: environment, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators."
"5","Humanoid robot as an intelligent agent","How does a humanoid robot function as an intelligent agent?","A humanoid robot perceives using sensors like microphones, force sensors, tactile sensors, video cameras, and an electronic nose and acts using joint motors and a loudspeaker. The environment for such a robot is theoretically anywhere. The visual shows a humanoid robot with labeled components: environment, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators."
"6","Difference to control system view","How does the AI setting differ from a control system view?","In control theory, there's typically a distinction between the system to be controlled and the environment, whereas in AI, this distinction is often not made. The visual shows a comparison between control system and AI settings with labeled plant, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators."
"7","Vacuum-cleaner world example","What is the vacuum-cleaner world in the context of intelligent agents?","The vacuum-cleaner world is an example where an agent perceives its environment as locations A or B with statuses like dirty or clean and acts using actions like Left, Right, Suck, or NoOp. Visuals include locations A and B with example percepts and actions."
"8","Agent function and percept sequence","What is an agent's percept sequence and agent function?","An agentâ€™s percept sequence is the complete history of its perception, such as [A, Dirty], [A, Clean], [B, Clean], [A, Clean]. An agent function maps any percept sequence to an action, enabling smarter choices with longer sequences."
"9","Tabular agent function example","How does a tabular agent function work in the vacuum-cleaner world?","A tabular agent function maps percept sequences like [A, Clean] to actions such as Right or Suck. The table rows show specific sequences and corresponding actions. An agent program called Reflex-Vacuum-Agent uses such a function to decide actions."
"10","Expressiveness and practicality of agent functions","What are the expressiveness and practicality of tabular agent functions?","Tabular agent functions can theoretically describe behavior but have no practical use due to their infinite or large size for even finite sequences. Examples include a camera recording with immense table size compared to the atoms in the universe."
"11","Rational agent concept","What defines a rational agent?","A rational agent is one that does the 'right thing,' ideally optimizing performance, which might not always have an obvious measure. For example, a vacuum cleaner can be evaluated by the cleanliness of floors over time."
"12","Omniscience, learning, and autonomy in agents","What is the difference between omniscience, learning, and autonomy in agents?","An omniscient agent knows the exact outcome, impossible in reality, while a rational agent maximizes expected performance. Learning allows agents to improve over time, and autonomy measures how dependent they are on prior knowledge."
"13","PEAS description for task environments","What is a PEAS description and how is it applied to an automated taxi?","PEAS stands for performance, environment, actuators, and sensors, detailing a task environment. For an automated taxi, performance includes safety and legality, the environment includes streets and traffic, actuators include steering and brakes, and sensors include video and radar."
"14","Properties of task environments","What are the properties of task environments?","Task environments vary: they can be fully or partially observable, single or multi-agent, deterministic or stochastic, episodic or sequential, discrete or continuous, static or dynamic, and known or unknown. Examples include chess as deterministic and automated taxi driving as stochastic and dynamic."
"15","Agent types","What are the types of agents categorized in AI?","Agents are categorized into simple reflex agents, reflex agents with state, goal-based agents, and utility-based agents. These range in complexity and generality and can all be developed further into learning agents."
"16","Simple reflex agents","How do simple reflex agents function?","Simple reflex agents act based solely on the current percept using condition-action rules. They work best in fully observable environments with complete implementation of the necessary rules. The vacuum-cleaner program is an example of such an agent."
"17","Model-based reflex agents","What are model-based reflex agents and how do they operate?","Model-based reflex agents extend simple reflex agents by maintaining an internal state that reflects unobservable aspects, allowing them to handle partially observable environments. Visual elements feature state updates and condition-action rules responsive to changes."
"18","Goal-based agents","How do goal-based agents differ from reflex agents?","Goal-based agents expand on model-based reflex agents by explicitly considering goals to guide actions. They evaluate potential actions by how well they achieve set goals, like preventing a vehicle from hitting a pedestrian by braking to avoid an accident."
"19","Utility-based agents","What are utility-based agents, and how do they function?","Utility-based agents aim not only to achieve goals but also to maximize utility or 'happiness' associated with the state. They evaluate trade-offs like safety vs. timeliness in a driving scenario to make informed actions."
"20","Learning agents and components","What components make up a learning agent, and how do they interact?","Learning agents include a performance element for actions, a learning element to improve based on experience, a critic to evaluate performances, and a problem generator to suggest new experiences for learning. They continuously adapt to improve system performance."
