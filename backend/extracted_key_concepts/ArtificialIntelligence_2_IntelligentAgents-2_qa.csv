"1","Intelligent agent definition and components","What is an intelligent agent?","An intelligent agent is anything that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon the environment through actuators. Visual elements include a diagram showing the environment, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators, with arrows indicating the flow of physical quantities and signals."
"2","Thermostat as an intelligent agent","How does a thermostat function as an intelligent agent?","A thermostat acts as an intelligent agent by perceiving temperature through sensors and acting upon a valve to control the room environment. The visual shows a thermostat with labeled components: environment, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators."
"3","Robotic lawn mower as an intelligent agent","How does a robotic lawn mower function as an intelligent agent?","A robotic lawn mower functions as an intelligent agent by using sensors like wheel rotation and magnetic sensors to perceive its environment and actuators like wheel motors and a cutting unit to act on the garden. The visual depicts a lawn mower with labeled components: environment, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators."
"4","Automated car as an intelligent agent","How does an automated car function as an intelligent agent?","An automated car acts as an intelligent agent by using sensors such as video cameras, laser sensors, radar, GPS, and acceleration sensors to perceive the road network and other traffic participants. It uses actuators like the steering wheel, brake, and throttle to act. The visual shows an automated car with labeled components: environment, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators."
"5","Humanoid as an intelligent agent","How does a humanoid function as an intelligent agent?","A humanoid functions as an intelligent agent by using sensors like microphones, force sensors, tactile sensors, video cameras, and an electronic nose to perceive its environment. It uses actuators like joint motors and a loudspeaker to act. The visual depicts a humanoid with labeled components: environment, sensors, intelligent agent, and actuators."
"6","Difference between AI and control system view","How does the AI view of agents differ from the control system view?","In control theory, there is a distinction between the system to be controlled and the environment, whereas in AI, this distinction is often not made. The visual shows a diagram with a plant, sensors, intelligent agent, actuators, and environment."
"7","Vacuum-cleaner world example","What is the vacuum-cleaner world example in intelligent agents?","The vacuum-cleaner world example involves an agent perceiving the location and contents, such as [A, Dirty], and taking actions like Left, Right, Suck, or NoOp. The visual shows locations A and B with possible percepts and actions."
"8","Agent function and percept sequence","What is an agent's percept sequence and how does it relate to the agent function?","An agent’s percept sequence is the complete history of its perception, and the agent function maps any given percept sequence to an action. For example, in the vacuum cleaner scenario, percept sequences like [A, Dirty] lead to actions like Suck. The visual shows a table mapping percept sequences to actions."
"9","Tabular agent function and reflex-vacuum-agent program","What is a tabular agent function and how does the reflex-vacuum-agent program work?","A tabular agent function describes the behavior of agents by mapping percept sequences to actions. The reflex-vacuum-agent program returns actions based on the status and location, such as Suck if dirty or moving right if in location A. The visual shows a table with percept sequences and corresponding actions."
"10","Expressiveness and practicality of agent functions","What is the expressiveness and practicality of tabular agent functions?","Tabular agent functions can theoretically describe the behavior of agents but are impractical due to their large or infinite size. An agent program is a practical implementation of an agent function. Examples include a 1-hour camera recording with a massive table size and chess with an estimated number of atoms in the universe comparison. The visual shows a comparison of table sizes."
"11","Rational agent and performance measure","What defines a rational agent and how is performance measured?","A rational agent is defined by its ability to do the 'right thing' with ideal performance. Performance measures are not always obvious and must be determined by the designer. For example, a vacuum cleaner's performance could be measured by the amount of dirt cleaned or by rewarding clean floors. The visual shows examples of performance measures."
"12","Factors influencing rationality","What factors influence the rationality of an agent?","Rationality depends on the performance measure, the agent’s prior knowledge of the environment, the actions the agent can perform, and the agent’s percept sequence. A rational agent selects actions expected to maximize performance based on these factors. The visual shows a diagram of factors influencing rationality."
"13","Omniscience, learning, and autonomy in agents","What is the difference between omniscience, learning, and autonomy in agents?","An omniscient agent knows the actual outcome of its actions, which is impossible in reality. Rational agents maximize expected performance and can learn from perception to improve their knowledge. Autonomy in AI refers to an agent's ability to rely less on prior knowledge and more on newly learned abilities. The visual shows a comparison of these concepts."
"14","PEAS description for task environments","What is the PEAS description and how is it used for task environments?","The PEAS description stands for performance, environment, actuators, and sensors. It is used to specify task environments for designing rational agents. Examples include an automated taxi with performance measures like safety and actuators like steering, and an internet shopping agent with performance measures like price and actuators like displaying to the user. The visual shows tables with PEAS descriptions."
"15","Properties of task environments","What are the properties of task environments?","Task environments can be fully or partially observable, single or multi-agent, deterministic or stochastic, episodic or sequential, discrete or continuous, static or dynamic, and known or unknown. Examples include a vacuum-cleaner world as partially observable and single agent, and taxi driving as partially observable, multi-agent, and dynamic. The visual shows examples and categorizations of task environments."
"16","Examples of task environments","What are some examples of task environments and their properties?","Examples of task environments include crossword puzzles (fully observable, single agent, deterministic, sequential, static, discrete), chess with a clock (fully observable, multi-agent, deterministic, sequential, semi-static, discrete), and taxi driving (partially observable, multi-agent, stochastic, sequential, dynamic, continuous). The visual shows a table with examples and their properties."
"17","Agent types and categories","What are the different types of agents and their categories?","Agents are categorized into simple reflex agents, reflex agents with state, goal-based agents, and utility-based agents, with increasing generality. All these can be turned into learning agents. The visual shows a list of agent types and their categories."
"18","Simple reflex agents","How do simple reflex agents function?","Simple reflex agents select actions based on the current percept using condition-action rules. They typically work in fully observable environments where all required rules are implemented. The vacuum-cleaner program is an example of a simple reflex agent. The visual shows a diagram of a simple reflex agent with sensors, condition-action rules, and actuators."
"19","Model-based reflex agents","How do model-based reflex agents function?","Model-based reflex agents extend simple reflex agents by handling partial observability through an internal state that tracks unobservable aspects. They include components for understanding how the world evolves and the effects of actions. The visual shows a diagram of a model-based reflex agent with sensors, state, condition-action rules, and actuators."
"20","Goal-based agents","How do goal-based agents function?","Goal-based agents extend model-based reflex agents by explicitly considering the goal of the agent. They evaluate what the world will be like if a certain action is taken and choose actions that help achieve the goal. The visual shows a diagram of a goal-based agent with sensors, state, goals, and actuators."
"21","Utility-based agents","How do utility-based agents function?","Utility-based agents extend goal-based agents by aiming to reach the goal state with maximum utility, maximizing the 'happiness' of the agent. They evaluate how happy the agent will be in a state and make decisions based on a utility function. The visual shows a diagram of a utility-based agent with sensors, state, utility, and actuators."
"22","Learning agents","How do learning agents function?","Learning agents can be any previous agent type extended to include learning capabilities. They have components like a performance element, learning element, critic, and problem generator. The learning element makes improvements based on experience, and the critic provides feedback on performance. The visual shows a diagram of a learning agent with these components."
